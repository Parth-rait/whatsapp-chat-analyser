[16/12/24, 4:58:30 PM] ~ Nikesh🖤✨: On the martyrdom of Somnath Suryawanshi

After the replica of the constitution was vandalised in Parbhani, the Ambedkarites in Parbhani resorted to public demonstrations. The public demonstrations show that the protesters regarded constitution as the most sacred book and it is rightly so. For the constitutionalism built India into a democratic republic. Underlying constitutionalism are the principles of democracy, federalism, and separation of powers. It also includes the rights of the citizens vis a vis the state. The right to criticise the government and uphold the constitution is not just the duty of the Ambedkarite but every citizen of India. It is pathetic that only Ambedkarite rose to protest in the defence of the constitution. Whenever the mob protests, in all likelihood, it creates the turmoil and at times leads to destruction of the private property. However this can not be considered as violence. The protestors did not turn violent though they were defending the very existence of India by registering their unacceptance of anti-India forces bent on destroying India by the destroying the constitution that constituted India. 

The administration and that too police administration must have the highest refrain and must act in a non violent ways to stop the mob from turning violent. The brutal force that police administration used in Parbhani against the honest defenders of the constitution is unacceptable. The protesters could be easily dealt with by the rule of law not by the arbitrary use of the brutal violent force. The images of police beating men and women in Parbhani are shocking and they can be seen in the regimes that are based on violence and violent ideologies. 

Somnath Suryawanshi was an upcoming lawyer and he understood what was at stake when the constitution was vandalised. As a law student, he was well aware of the right to protest and right to criticize the government as the fundamental right of every citizen. The post-mortem examination shows that he succumbed to the multiple injuries caused by the brutal violent by the police. As we can create the situation in the custody, brother Somnath must be asserting his rights in the face of the brutality of the police and often untrained police made a mockery of the upcoming lawyer by using brutal force that killed him eventually. Now imagine hundreds who are held in the police custody and what would be happening to them. 

People at large are questioning the validity of the recently held elections in Maharashtra and there is an eerie silence after the election results. People at large are loosing faith in the government institutions and that too in the election commission of India which is an office created under the constitution and supposed to act in the interest of the nation and not in the interest of the political parties. The ECI should have taken note of people’s rising concerns over the election results. 

Why is it to be addressed? 

The citizens should have unshakeable faith in the institutions of government. Martyr Somnath Suryawanshi expressed his discontent, in his discontent lies his love for his country and the constitution that created it. His discontent expressed his deep love for India and the state failed him by killing him brutally at the very site that should protect its citizens. As reported by the police to the journalists that Somnath was not Buddhist but came from Vadar community. Youths in the Vadar community are getting awakened and the movement is not just confined to the Buddhists in Maharashtra and it never was. When Babasaheb Ambedkar was leading the movement for democracy, all the suffering castes joined. The greatest stumbling block in the realisation of the social democracy in India is the “double consciousness” of the OBCs, the Shudras who are the foot soldiers of the Brahmins and every now and then are slammed by the Brahmins and kept away from power but they are in the forefront to slam the Scheduled castes though they should be working with them to destroy the hegemony of the Brahmins. In reality, the entire India should rise and acknowledge the martyrdom of Somnath as the defender of Indian constitution and of the Indian nation itself. 

Long live the courage of brother Somnath to offer his life for the country that itself killed him!

[17/01/25, 7:25:07 PM] ~ Bhavesh Kadu: Dear Students,
As I began to work individually and in groups, I came up with some ideas on mental health to work for students like practice circles, events, games/competitions, etc. To get ideas into action, I needed support. Therefore, students might be the right person who may wish to express interest in mental health work. Even if you are new to this mental health field, that is alright! *Perhaps, your skills like working individually or as a team, brainstorming on ideas or report writing, or interest in art/craft and use of Canva or digital platforms would greatly support it.*

Since we began with Tuesday Mindfulness Practice Circle four months ago, we have been running it successfully for students. Also, multiple events have taken place, like Mental Health Week, a workshop on New Year's Resolutions, etc., so those events help to engage students in their mental health and well-being. We are looking for more student volunteers to join our team. If you still feel so, connect to work together.
 
*The time needed from the volunteer is as and when required. It is not long-term work.

This is an important message for all of you.

For your safety, it’s strongly advised to stay away from that side. If anything happens, neither the administration nor anyone else may be able to assist you in time.

Please take this seriously, prioritize your safety  and circulate this message in class group too.

We hope you've gone through the brochure and the other information shared here regarding the *Teach for India Fellowship* .

1. It's *mandatory to register* in that link before joining the session.
2. It's also recommended that you use *TISS email ID* for registration.
3. The session is open for all the students, but since this *paid fellowship is full-time* , it is likely that only BA 3rd and MA 2nd year students will apply for it.

If the people can't motivate these young students practising, they should not discourage them by offensively shouting to vacate the amphitheater. 
I urge you all to please maintain the decorum so that these students can at least give their best.. They have exams, still practising.. 

Such an offensive practice is condemnable and has been complained about.. 

Kindly, don't discourage the kids..

The CGPC team requests your cooperation and support in maintaining a professional and respectful atmosphere on campus for the next few days from 11-13th March. We have recruiters from prestigious organizations visiting our campus, and they will be staying in the guest house.

As you are aware, placement is a crucial aspect of our academic journey, and our behavior and hospitality towards recruiters play a significant role in the selection process. We urge you to extend your support in making this placement drive a success.

The placement process will take place in the Gymkhana Building. We request that you maintain proper decorum and discipline in and around the premises.

Your cooperation and understanding are greatly appreciated.

Thank you,
CGPC Team

Here are the details:

Name: Khushbu Khandekar
Address: Flat No. 201, Subhash Nagar, Nagpur
Hospital Name: Neuron Hospital, Nagpur

Please support her in this difficult time. 🙏

हे भारत के राम जगो, मैं तुम्हे जगाने आया हूँ,
सौ धर्मों का धर्म एक, बलिदान बताने आया हूँ ।
सुनो हिमालय कैद हुआ है, दुश्मन की जंजीरों में
आज बता दो कितना पानी, है भारत के वीरो में,
खड़ी शत्रु की फौज द्वार पर, आज तुम्हे ललकार रही,
सोये सिंह जगो भारत के, माता तुम्हे पुकार रही ।
रण की भेरी बज रही, उठो मोह निद्रा त्यागो,
पहला शीष चढाने वाले, माँ के वीर पुत्र जागो।
बलिदानों के वज्रदंड पर, देशभक्त की ध्वजा जगे,
और रण के कंकण पहने है, वो राष्ट्रभक्त की भुजा जगे ।।
अग्नि पंथ के पंथी जागो, शीष हथेली पर धरकर,
जागो रक्त के भक्त लाडले, जागो सिर के सौदागर,
खप्पर वाली काली जागे, जागे दुर्गा बर्बंडा,
और रक्त बीज का रक्त चाटने, वाली जागे चामुंडा ।
नर मुंडो की माला वाला, जगे कपाली कैलाशी,
रण की चंडी घर घर नाचे, मौत कहे प्यासी प्यासी,
रावण का वध स्वयं करूँगा, कहने वाला राम जगे,
और कौरव शेष न एक बचेगा, कहने वाला श्याम जगे ।।
परशुराम का परशु जगे, रघुनन्दन का बाण जगे ,
यदुनंदन का चक्र जगे, अर्जुन का धनुष महान जगे,
चोटी वाला चाणक्य जगे, पौरुष का पुरष महान जगे
और सेल्यूकस को कसने वाला, चन्द्रगुप्त बलवान जगे ।
हठी हमीर जगे जिसने, झुकना कभी नहीं जाना,
जगे पद्मिनी का जौहर, जागे केसरिया बाना,
देशभक्ति का जीवित झण्डा, आजादी का दीवाना,
और वह प्रताप का सिंह जगे, वो हल्दी घाटी का राणा
दक्खिन वाला जगे शिवाजी, खून शाहजी का ताजा,
मरने की हठ ठाना करते, विकट मराठो के राजा,
छत्रसाल बुंदेला जागे, पंजाबी कृपाण जगे,
दो दिन जिया शेर के माफिक, वो टीपू सुल्तान जगे ।
कनवाहे का जगे मोर्चा, जगे झाँसी की रानी,
अहमदशाह जगे लखनऊ का, जगे कुंवर सिंह बलिदानी,
कलवाहे का जगे मोर्चा, पानीपत मैदान जगे,
जगे भगत सिंह की फांसी, राजगुरु के प्राण जगे
जिसकी छोटी सी लकुटी से (बापू ), संगीने भी हार गयी,
हिटलर को जीता वे फौजेे, सात समुन्दर पार गयी,
मानवता का प्राण जगे, और भारत का अभिमान जगे,
उस लकुटि और लंगोटी वाले, बापू का बलिदान जगे।
आजादी की दुल्हन को जो, सबसे पहले चूम गया,
स्वयं कफ़न की गाँठ बाँधकर, सातों भावर घूम गया,
उस सुभाष की शान जगे, उस सुभाष की आन जगे,
ये भारत देश महान जगे, ये भारत की संतान जगे ।
क्या कहते हो मेरे भारत से चीनी टकराएंगे ?
अरे चीनी को तो हम पानी में घोल घोल पी जाएंगे,
वह बर्बर था वह अशुद्ध था, हमने उनको शुद्ध किया,
वह बर्बर था वह अशुद्ध था, हमने उनको शुद्ध किया,
हमने उनको बुद्ध दिया था, उसने हमको युद्ध दिया ।
आज बँधा है कफ़न शीष पर, जिसको आना है आ जाओ,
चाओ-माओ चीनी-मीनी, जिसमें दम हो टकराओ
जिसके रण से बनता है, रण का केसरिया बाना,
ओ कश्मीर हड़पने वाले, कान खोल सुनते जाना ।।
भारत के केसर की कीमत तो केवल सर है
कोहिनूर की कीमत जूते पांच अजर अमर हैं
रण के खेतो में जब छायेगा, अमर मृत्यु का सन्नाटा,
रण के खेतो में जब छायेगा, अमर मृत्यु का सन्नाटा,
लाशो की जब रोटी होंगी, और बारूदों का आटा,
सन सन करते वीर चलेंगे, जो बामी से फन वाला,
फिर चाहे रावलपिंडी वाले हो, या हो पेकिंग वाला ।
जो हमसे टकराएगा, वो चूर चूर हो जायेगा,
इस मिटटी को छूने वाला, मिटटी में मिल जायेगा,
मैं घर घर में इन्कलाब की, आग लगाने आया हूँ,
हे भारत के राम जगो, मैं तुम्हे जगाने आया हूं ।।

[10/04/25, 12:09:31 AM] ~ Mehak Tiwari: First of all Thank you for coming and making this event a special one. We apologise (Mala mafa kara) if we were short at anything and if you had any shortcomings. Apart from that on a very personal note I would like to say this that for a person like me campus life won't be same. There were almost all of the people in the senior batch whom I have crossed path and had really impacted me in some way or the other. Some inspired me for being myself, some made me laugh, some teased me like their own sibling and some were nothing less that a best friend I could ever ask for. Ofcourse the bond with your own batch is something else but the bond with you all hits at a different level. Thank you for being there and for existing. Conveying all the happiness and best wishes to each one of you. Thank you for making this campus life bearable with your insights , sometimes being guiding angel , sharing your experiences to navigate through all this and what not? 

Stay in touch!! 

Really lots of love

[13/04/25, 12:00:11 PM] ~ S. Vaishnavi: Greetings to allll

Many people in the *Old Girls Hostel* have encountered cases of Theft (cash)  in the last few days and robbery of other personal belongings has also occured . 
So we sincerely request SENIORS of all batches to kindly follow the below stated:

1. Please don't *enter* or  *stay overnight* at the Old Girls Hostel .   ( We don't exactly find it      comfortable to find  random didis in our room suddenly in the morning🙏🏻) & you might be a suspect in cases of robbery. 

2. During College  events and it's preparation a lot of seniors enter the hostel and use the washrooms and we understand that our hostel is conveniently accessible but many girls are experiencing UTIs and such and it becomes difficult to keep a track of who all are using the washroom and who all are at a  risk of an infection.  BUT still if you're using it under necessary conditions then kindly flush after every use and keep it clean 
         *( Our washrooms are strictly not  for public use but under necessary conditions it is understandable from our side too*) 

3. Again during events please just *don't abruptly enter the rooms* asking for stuff ( even if you know some first year  from that room really well, it is still weird and just downright invasive & you know it better than us )  

4. If you're a senior who's just curious about the rooms in our hostel and wants to have a look at our space then  please convey the same to any one of us and we'll show you the same , promptly. *But don't enter on your own accord, as per your liking*

We respect your needs and understand where you're coming from but *kindly refrain from entering the hostel at all* . 
We also understand that  many you've previously occupied this space and have a affiliation towards this space but still, now because things are getting *seriously shady and  weird* we don't want any strangers barging into our space . A lot has been compromised already. 

Regards 
BA First Year Girls

[14/04/25, 11:00:55 AM] ~ Aditya Kamble: https://www.instagram.com/share/reel/BAXPXYYOkO
Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar's Jayanti stands apart. It is a celebration that unites across caste, religion, gender, and geography. No other figure in Indian history has impacted as many lives across such a vast spectrum. From drafting the Constitution to empowering women, from water resource policies to the establishment of institutions like RBI, from championing labor rights to fighting untouchability - Dr. Ambedkar's contributions touch every Indian, directly or indirectly.

Yet, Babasaheb's legacy continues to be challenged - not by facts, but by propaganda. Casteism, fake historical narratives, and cultural superiority complexes continue to dominate public discourse. Every caste atrocity, every denial of dignity, every incident of systemic exclusion is a reminder that the fight he began is far from over.

This April 14th, as we celebrate the birth of the architect of modern India, let's not just wear blue - let's wear courage, awareness, and unity.
Jai Bhim 💙📓🎉🔥

I hope you're doing well. I’m currently looking to connect with a *social worker or organization based in India* that is actively working in the area of *communal harmony, peacebuilding, or interfaith/inter-community dialogue*. This is part of a project/research interest, and I’m hoping to learn from or possibly collaborate with practitioners in this field.

If you or someone you know is involved in such work, I’d really appreciate your help in connecting. Please feel free to reach out to me here or via direct message.

Thank you so much in advance!

[03/05/25, 11:22:07 PM] Sansthita: Dearest Seniors,

As we gathered to bid farewell to an unforgettable batch of seniors, we celebrated not just your achievements but the incredible memories, guidance, and warmth you left behind. This evening was more than just a goodbye—it was a tribute to the walks once taken down Yellow Street, the escapes once found on Second and Third Hill, the jokes cracked over countless boring DH meals, and the festivals that once lit up the amphitheatre with joy.

Now that you will step into the world beyond these walls, we send you with immense pride, deep gratitude, and heartfelt wishes for a future filled with success, joy, and fulfilment.

Though the campus will feel a little emptier without your laughter and presence, your legacy will remain in the lessons you've shared and the stories that will continue to be told long after you've gone.

We don't say goodbye today, we say thank you. Thank you for the warmth, the memories, and the impact you've made. We wish you the brightest futures and hope you carry forward the warmth and light you hold wherever you go.

You will be deeply missed, forever remembered, and always celebrated :)

Here's a small gift from us to you, we hope when you scroll through this, it makes you smile❤

With love,
Batch 2023-27 & 2024-2028
